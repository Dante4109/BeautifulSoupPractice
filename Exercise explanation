1. The website at first glance is using default.aspx as its ending suffix. Default.aspx in ASP.NET
web application is the default startup page if we do not specify the page
in URL. This tells me the page is most likely using webforms or MVC. Either way its an asp.net site. I can expect a C# backend at the very least. 
Most likely server side rendering. It's also not using HTTPs so I know its even older and leads me towawrds webforms. This also means the site isn't secure and isn't using signed certificates. 
The data being sent from the server to the client is not encrypted via TLS/SSL. Granted there is a SSL certificates about at the footer so perhaps it just expired. 

The search call revealed the following request url in the chrome developer tools network tab. http://www.armedicalboard.org/Public/verify/lookup.aspx?LicNum=PA-340 
Example Record PA-340 - Frank Jay Smith, PA

Attempted wilcard search but that wasn't supported. 

No response data is visible meaning this is not using a separate api and is a tightly coupled webapp as most webforms apps are. 
The url request will take you straight to the webpage where the data is rendered. The url will however redirect to a url using a different ID to identify the searched provider. 

http://www.armedicalboard.org/Public/verify/results.aspx?strPHIDNO=ASMB18409 = PA-340
http://www.armedicalboard.org/Public/verify/results.aspx?strPHIDNO=ASMB23602 = PA-341

http://www.armedicalboard.org/Public/verify/results.aspx?strPHIDNO=ASMB23602

The search criteria uses ASMB**** as the true ID to check for practioners. 

ASMB = Arkansas State Medical Board

2. At a glance there's effectively two optional searh criteria we can use. One is the prefix presented for PA aka license number. 
The other option is the actual true ID that the site redirects to ASMB****
I chose to use the ASMB request url to bypass the issue with the redirect. Alternatiavely I could use web driver 
but that would be more resource intensive and expensive. 

also confirmed ASMB starts at index 0

1. The search page for this site is a spa (single page application). It's fairly plain so most likely it was made with an older
JS framework. When searching for data it is returned via a json call. The provided example when applied to the search box
